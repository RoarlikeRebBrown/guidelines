    status: draft
    level: 1 (legal requirement and / or requirement from financial institutions)

    description:
      general: |
        Bestiality is defined as:

        > the act of a human having sex with a non-human animal

        While zoophilia is a :

        > term used to describe a humans who is sexually attracted to and/ or arroused by a non-human animal

        It's important to state that these are two different things. A zoophile might have never participated in bestiality, while someone who has done bestiality might not be a zoophile. It's also important to note bestiality is illegal in many places, zoophilia is not.

        On FetLife, we don't allow:

        - Sharing of any real picture or videos involving bestiality
        - Looking for or telling people to participate in bestiality
        - Links to bestiality porn

        We do allow however:

        - Intellectual debates and discussions about zoophilia & bestiality
        - Admitting to being a zoophile
        - Admitting to having had experience with an animal
        - Hentai bestaility and monster porn
        - Tentacle (tentacle dildos or hentai only) porn

  executive_summary: |
    In many countries, bestiality is illegal as well as the sale, distribution, and ownership of bestiality porn.

    Germany is an interesting country where bestiality is illegal if the animail is forced but it is legal if the animals is not forced. In Germany it's also legal to own bestiality porn but illegal to sell or distribute it.

    The arguments around bestiatlity often times revolve around consent and animal cruelty. Many argue that animals can't consent while others believe that if an animal is not forced there shouldn't be any issues with bestiality.

    In our research, we couldn't find any reputable sites that had any:

    - Real bestiality pics or vids

    But we could find many reputable sites that had:

    - Hentai beast porn
    - Hentai tentacle porn
    - Adults enjoying dog, horse, and tentacle dildos

      summary: |
        From Wikipedia's article on [Zoophilia and the Law]():

        > Laws against **humans performing sex acts on animals, where they exist, are concerned with the actual act**, which it commonly refers to as bestiality, rather than the sexual attraction to animals. For this reason, prohibitions of zoophilic pornography are more varied; they may be unlawful if an actual sex act with an animal is involved, but the status is not clear-cut if there is a mere representation, such as a painting or cartoon. In that case, normal obscenity laws will normally apply. All zoophilic imagery is widely regarded as pornography.

        International differences in the law:

        > Some jurisdictions list laws very clearly, such as England and Wales, which specifically prohibits penetration of a human being by the penis of an animal, and penetration of an animal by a human's penis.[9]
        >
        > By contrast, many countries and US states are less precise about the scope of law in that they outlaw sex with animals, without defining what constitutes "sex".
        >
        > Even if bestiality is not explicitly prohibited, there are often many other laws which can be used to effectively prosecute cases. For example, most countries have animal cruelty laws, and a prosecutor will argue that all zoophilia activity is animal abuse.[10] In some U.S. states, a person who engages in bestiality can be charged with animal cruelty.

        With respect to animal pornography in cartoons:

        > Erotic art, such as animal pornography in cartoons and the like, which does not require the recording of an actual sexual act, are not usually considered sex with animals by the law, and so their status depends upon more general laws such as legal limits upon obscenity or pornography alone, and the thin line between erotic art and pornography.

        Interesting fact, currently in Germany bestiality is illegal if the animal is forced, and legal if the animal is not forced.

        From an articl on the [Difference Between Bestiality and Zoophilia](https://www.liveabout.com/what-is-the-difference-between-bestiality-and-zoophilia-2983266) the difference between the two is stated as:

        > Many people confuse the terms bestiality and zoophilia. They are related, but different.
        >
        > Bestiality has always referred to the act of a human having sex with a non-human animal. The sexual activities may or may not involve penetration, but they are sexual behaviors done for gratification.
        >
        > Zoophilia was first used in clinical literature by the sexologist Richard von Krafft-Ebing, who used the term to describe a human being who is sexually aroused or inspired by an animal. Today zoophilia is still used to describe the feelings of erotic or sexual attachment to, and/or a sexual preference for, non-human animals.
        >
        > The easiest way to distinguish bestiality and zoophilia is to say that bestiality is a practice -- it's something people do. Zoophilia is a preference or experience, something people feel. Not everyone who engages in bestiality is a zoophile, and not all people who identify or would be classified as having zoophilia actually have sex with animals.
        >
        > Another important distinction to make is that only having erotic feelings or fantasies involving animals is not against the law, whereas in many places, having sexual relations with a non-human animal is illegal.
